## Time to setup a Version Control System!
Setting up VCS with VSC is actually pretty simple (even if I have made this guide rather wordy) and will **highly** benefit you in the long-run. Not only with modding, but with general coding, no matter what/where you code. We'll be using Git + GitHub.

### Setting up a GitHub repo
If you don't want to share your mod with anyone that's fine, you can make your repo private. But I still recomment a repo. It will:
* Let you revert to an earlier state of your mod in case you horribly screw something up
* Let you share your code with people in #modding fairly easiy if you need help debugging
* Keep your data backed up in case some disaster happens
* Build good programming habits
Always have a repo. There's no reason not to. So:
0. Register a new account on GitHub and login if you haven't already.
1. Press the plus button at the top right, and press New repository

3. Name it something nice like OSFE-YourModName or some such
4. Make it public or private as you wish. Keep in mind that making it private will prevent you from sharing your code on github with others if you want help.
5. We'll manually add a .gitignore cause this project is a little unique.
6. Add a lisence, if you wish. MIT is a good for mods, and translates to "everyone can use this but it has to be MIT too".
